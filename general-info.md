# Abstract 600 Chars

Does a Rails model or config file seem like a magical syntax? Or can you read any Ruby code and understand it as the interpreter does?

Ruby's implicitness makes it great for readability and DSLs. But that also gives Ruby a "magical" syntax compared to JavaScript.

In this talk, let's convert the implicit to explicit in some familiar Rails code. What was "magic" will become simple, understandable code.

After this talk, you'll see Ruby through a new lens, and your Ruby reading comprehension will improve. As a bonus, I'll share a few Pry tips to demystify any Ruby code.


# Pitch


## Why this talk?

For the last five years, I've been interviewing Ruby developer candidates. It amazes me how few can truly explain what a line of Ruby code is doing, especially if that line is more DSL-like, such as calling **validates** on a Rails model.

The focus for most new programmers is writing code. However, that often means copy/pasting examples without true comprehension. By making the implicit explicit, I'll show Rails developers of all levels how to improve their ability to both read and write Ruby code. Reading is especially critical, as experienced developers often consult a Gem's source code.


## Why me?



*   I've been blogging about Ruby since 2013.
*   I've spoken at 2 Rails Conferences and once at the Gotham Ruby Conference.
*   Before my Rails career, I spoke at Dr. Dobbs conferences on Java and Test Drive Development.
*   I'm experienced at screencasting and prerecording a talk. I'm an egghead.io instructor, and I presented at the last RailsConf where the presentation had to be prerecorded.
*   I interview lots of candidates for Ruby jobs, so I see these gaps in the basics.
*   I'm a passionate Ruby open source contributor.
    *   One of my open source projects has 4600+ stars and 4.6M downloads.
    *   Several other of my open source projects get thousands of downloads every week.
*   My experience with JavaScript allows me to contrast the explicit in JavaScript to the implicit in Ruby.

In 2015, he created the gem "React on Rails," which integrated server-side rendered React and Webpack with Rails long before the Webpacker gem. These days, as CEO of ShakaCode.com, he helps companies optimize their Rails websites. He and his ShakaCode team also build Rails apps with modern front-ends, including their startup app, HiChee.com.
